    <h1 id="hz">Favourite type of holiday</h1>
    <h3 id="Hell">My favorite holiday is Halloween because of costumes and decorations.
        My first acquaintance with this holiday was when I started watching streams and came across one YouTuber 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheNeptooN" id="NooN">The NeptooN</a> who I still watch.
        Now onto the next thing that makes Halloween such a great holiday, the costumes and decorations.
        I mean things from famous horror icons like Jason,Pennywise,Freddy Krueger,Ghost face and many more.
        Then there are people is own horrifying creations like dressing as ghosts or zombies.
        When I started celebrating Halloween,I started watching movies and streams of horror games while enjoying this holiday.
        I have a list of films on this topic,but using the example of "Freddy Krueger","Friday the Thirteenth","Saw","Scream","It" and "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" they are the most favorite on the list.
        In conclusion this holiday is wonderful for me because this holiday has a cool vibe of magic that is not associated with logic
